# Python Pomodoro Timer

I often find myself losing track of time, so I built this little application to pop a notification on the desktop every X minutes to ensure I actually take breaks!  
A quick iteration of a pomodoro timer, using SQLite3 to store how many have been completed.  
Uses CustomTkinter and plyer for display/notifications
